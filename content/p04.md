# 04 - Straight ahead & Pose to Pose

### Straight ahead refers to an animation where it is drawn frame by frame.
### Pose to pose refers to drawing the start and end of the an animation and coming back and filling in the rest afterwards.
### Straight ahead is good for unprdictable motions scuh as fire.
### Pose to pose is good when you are creating a motion of a person waving their arm,  you would then know where the start and finish is and be able to fill in the rest.

## Use in animation
### I used straight ahead so I could get a sense of where the objects in each scene would start and end up.
### Thus I could then fill in the spaces in between and complete the animation.
