## Outcome
### Overall I think the animation was all right.
### The parallax background scrolling added a nice touch to the scene.
### There was a point where sword breaks and shortly afterwards the enemy falls down, there is a little bit of overlapping with these two animations which I 
### I did not know exactlly how the characters where going to fight when I first created the storyboards.
### I came up with the idea of showing a number above the two characters heads showing that they had taken damage.
### Added a health bar or something to show the remaing health would have made this easier to understand.

### By making the enterance to the forest on a layer in front of the main character, it gives a good effect showing that he has entered the forest.
### This was not clear in the storyboards that the character was actually in the forest. 


## Things to change 
### The title was rather standard as text on a white background. Adding some style to this would have made it better.
### The characters could have been a bit closer together in the fighting scene.
