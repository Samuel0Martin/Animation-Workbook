# 06 - Slow in Slow out

### When an object starts moving or ends moving it would not come to a complete stop immediately.
### It would gradually increase in speed when starting.
### And would gradually slow down when stopping.
### A ball would not start at top speed when it begins falling it would build up speed over time.
