# 02 - Anticipation

### The animation that prepares for the main action
### A spring would squish down before it pops back up gives the effect of anticipation.

## Image example:
<img src="img/02.png" alt="">


## Use in animation
### I used this when the chest opens the viewer would expect something to come out of the chest.
